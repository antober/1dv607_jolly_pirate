** Source code **


1. Move verbose, compact list to view, instead of including them in MemberDAL where the list
    containing members are.

2. Encapsulated private fields of Model classes, Member and Boat. The plan is to have some validation in the models as well.

3. RegisterModel class was beginning to get cluttered as we added more functionality, so we moved InitMemberMenu(..) 
    to the Controller class. Now we have two controller-like methods handling requests and calling methods accordingly.

4. We have changed names to separate methods in View class from other class methods, as we noticed that a lot of methods 
    did the same thing but differently, like GetMemberID() from view can also be a method name in MemberDAL where we fetch 
    a member by given id.
    Now methods in View class start with show as it is more appropriate to describe what the methods does.
    In the future we could refine these methods and separate the collecting and returning of input-values from the printed 
    message.

// CHanges after final hand-in

1. Separated View and Model (RegisterModel).
2. Changed names on methods and parameternames in RegisterModel.cs.
3. Refactored a few methods in View.cs to handle userinput in a restricted way. Now there is only 2 methods handling integers given by a user. 



** Diagram **

1. Sequence diagrams were totally remade with the old ones used as a basisâ€¦

2. The Class Diagram was also changed. We removed all fields and methods, and focused mainly on the field used as associations. 
    We also needed to make changes after the source-code was modified.


// Future changes

1. Change public memberlist to private, set to readonly, and private set method. Add the read-only memberList in RegisterModel.

2. Change action choice in member menu to enums.
